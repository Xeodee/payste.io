Payste is a CSS framework for older CMS systems that is lightweight, compact and very impactful for responsive needs.
***
All you need for Payste to work is simply paste the CSS in your head tag and boom, you magically have a working, responsive site that was built in the dino ages!

Creating a column layout in CSS is very simple with Payste.

One Column layout Markup:
```html
    <section class="col c1">
        <h2>First Column.<h2> <!-- this adds a header -->
        <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
    </section>
```

Very simple? Yes. Now to create a 2 column layout the HTML is simple:
```html
    <section class="col c2">
        <h2>First Column.<h2> <!-- this adds a header -->
        <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
    </section>
    <section class="col c2">
        <h2>Second Column.</h2>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>
    </section>
```

To add more columns replace c2 with c1-c5.

Payste, so simple.. its amazing.
